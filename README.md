I will put in this repo all the tensorflow's utilities that I have developed in order to automatize parts of my deep learning processes carried on with TensorFlow.

# tf_math
Some functions that I didn't find in literature developed by me in order to carry out some intricate mathematical operation in a very fast way (exploiting tensorflow functions and methods).
# TFInputPipeline
This is the jupyter notebook containing the code related to the blog post "Optimizing a TensorFlow Input Pipeline: Best Practices in 2022" by Stefano Martire (https://medium.com/@virtualmartire/optimizing-a-tensorflow-input-pipeline-best-practices-in-2022-4ade92ef8736).

# ULTRAFILTRO
"ultrafiltro.py" contains the algorithms that I use in order to build arbitrarily complex computer vision's datasets with just 3-4 lines of code. The complete explanaiton of all its components is contained in the file.
